# ReservationSystem
The reservation system was a project to create and store dinner reservations using an array list.
The user interface guides the user as they create, display, change, and cancel reservations.
The reservations are sorted using bubble sort based on the time they were booked for.
The two bonus features that my system has are added time and priority.
I learned how to use the Date feature to create times based ont the inputted strings.
To compare the two dates I turned them into an integer based on the number of seconds the time is after midnight and compared those. This allowed me to have very accurate comparisons.
The other feature that I added was priority based on time the reservation was created.
The priority assigned an integer for each of the reservations starting at 1 and going up until the max amount of reservations.
The priority was then bubble sorted based on the time that the reservations were created.
In a restaurant schenario this would help the restaurant to more easially tell which reservation to prioritize without having to compare a bunch of times themselves.
